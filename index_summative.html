    <h2>The problem</h2>
    <p>Clean water and sanitaion is a major problem all over the world, and there are many countries in the world that don't have clean water or sanitation. Many of these countries that are like this are known, but there are still parts of many developed countries that also don't have clean water or sanitation, such as Flint, Michigan. The main problem with this is that people need clean water for everyday activities. An example of this would be a village in Africa where there is no clean water to drink. These people are forced to drink dirty water which causes sickness, or drink no water and die from the extreme heat and exposure to the sun. The people of flint suffer similarly, because they don't have any clean water in their town, and are forced to connect to the Detroit water plant and have to run the water a long distance, which is very expensive for them.</p>
